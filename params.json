{"name":"Core Animation Chapter 1 - Section 1 The layer tree","tagline":"Core Animation","body":"_Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers._\r\n-- Shrek\r\n\r\nCore Animation is misleadingly named. You might assume that its primary purpose is animation, but actually animation is only one facet of the framework, which originally bore the less animation-centric name of Layer Kit.\r\nCore Animation的名字有点误导性，看到这个名字你可能会认为它的主要功能是animaton动画，但其实动画只是这个framework的一方面，它原来的名字其实是Layer Kit，看起来就没那么让你觉得它是以动画为中心。\r\nCore Animation is a compositing engine; its job is to compose different pieces of visual content on the screen, and to do so as fast as possible. The content in question is divided into individual layers stored in a hierarchy known as the layer tree. This tree forms the underpinning for all of UIKit, and for everything that you see on the screen in an iOS application.\r\nCore Animation是一个合成(compositing)引擎，它的主要任务就是尽可能快的把要显示的不同的内容合成并显示在屏幕上，要显示的内容被分成不同的layer并按照层级存储，这些层级存储的layer就被成为layer树(layer tree)。这些tree组成了UIKit的基础，也是你在iOS应用中看到屏幕上的所有东西的基础。\r\nBefore we discuss animation at all, we’re going to cover Core Animation’s static compositing and layout features, starting with the layer tree.\r\n在我们讨论任何动画之前，我们要先把Core Aniamtion的静态合成、布局特点讲清楚，让我们先从layer tree开始。\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
